1. Executive Summary

The U2 Elite Foundation relies on digital systems to manage youth program registrations, donor information, internal communications, and community operations. As the organization grows, so does its exposure to cyber threats that could compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, or damage the foundation’s reputation.

This risk assessment identifies the most significant cybersecurity risks across U2 Elite Foundation’s information systems. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the assessment evaluates each risk based on likelihood and impact, prioritizes them using a standardized scoring model, and provides actionable mitigation strategies.

The assessment highlights several high-priority risks, including phishing-based account compromise, misconfigured cloud storage, and unpatched devices used during programs and events. Addressing these risks will strengthen the foundation’s security posture, protect participant and donor information, and enhance operational resilience.

2. Organization Overview

The U2 Elite Foundation is a nonprofit organization focused on youth athletics, community development, and performance training. The foundation manages a range of programs including basketball training, academic support, mental performance development, and community events. To support these operations, U2 Elite relies on a combination of cloud-based platforms, digital communication systems, and online registration tools.

The organization handles sensitive information such as participant records, donor details, volunteer data, event registrations, and internal documents. Operations are supported by a hybrid team consisting of full-time staff, part-time coaches, and volunteers who frequently access systems using personal and organizational devices.

Because nonprofit organizations often operate with limited IT resources, U2 Elite faces evolving cyber risks related to email security, data protection, cloud misconfigurations, and reliance on third-party vendors. This assessment provides a structured approach to identifying and prioritizing those risks to ensure the foundation maintains a secure and resilient environment for its athletes, families, and staff.

3. Methodology

This risk assessment uses a structured approach based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which provides industry-standard guidelines for identifying, evaluating, and managing cybersecurity risks. The assessment follows a five-step process designed to ensure consistency, clarity, and actionable outcomes.

3.1 Framework Used

NIST CSF
The assessment aligns identified risks and recommended controls with the five core NIST CSF functions:

Identify (ID) – Understanding assets, risks, and organizational context

Protect (PR) – Safeguards to limit or contain security events

Detect (DE) – Activities to discover cybersecurity events

Respond (RS) – Actions taken once a security incident is detected

Recover (RC) – Restoration of systems and operations

3.2 Risk Scoring Model

Each risk is evaluated using a Likelihood × Impact formula on a scale from 1 to 5.

Likelihood: The probability that a threat could exploit a vulnerability

Impact: The severity of consequences if the event occurs

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

Scores are categorized as:

1–5: Low

6–10: Medium

11–15: Medium–High

16–25: High

3.3 Assessment Process

Identify Assets: Determine critical systems, data, and operational components.

Identify Threats & Vulnerabilities: Examine potential events that could negatively impact security.

Score Risks: Apply the Likelihood × Impact model to all risks.

Document Risks: Create a structured risk register containing scores, controls, and NIST mappings.

Recommend Controls: Align mitigation strategies with NIST CSF categories for clarity and best-practice alignment.

4. Asset Inventory

This assessment focuses on the critical assets that support the U2 Elite Foundation’s operations, programs, and community engagement. These assets include sensitive data, cloud-based systems, financial tools, and the devices used by staff and volunteers. Each asset plays a key role in delivering services and therefore requires protection against cybersecurity risks.

4.1 Critical Assets Identified
Asset	Description	Importance
Participant & Donor Data	Personal information, emergency contacts, waivers, and donation history collected through online forms and registration systems.	High
Staff & Volunteer Accounts	Email accounts, calendars, and shared documents used for operations, scheduling, and communication.	High
Google Workspace (Cloud Storage)	Central repository for rosters, training plans, administrative documents, photos, and operational resources.	High
Payment Systems (Stripe, QuickBooks)	Platforms used for donations, event fees, and financial tracking.	High
Website & Program Registration Portal	Public-facing site where families register for programs and events.	Medium–High
Event Devices (Laptops/Tablets)	Devices used for scorekeeping, registration, and event operations; often in shared or mobile environments.	Medium
Social Media Accounts	Used for marketing, community outreach, and brand communication (Instagram, Facebook).	Medium
Communication Platforms	Messaging or scheduling tools used by staff (e.g., Gmail, GroupMe).	Medium
4.2 Asset Considerations

Assets contain sensitive personal data, similar to small healthcare or education organizations.

Cloud-based systems increase flexibility but also increase exposure to misconfigurations.

Event devices may be used on unsecured networks, increasing risk.

Social media accounts are high-value targets for brand impersonation or takeover.

Understanding these assets allows the organization to evaluate risks more accurately and prioritize controls aligned with operational needs.

5. Risk Assessment Results

The risks identified for the U2 Elite Foundation were evaluated using the Likelihood × Impact scoring model. Each risk was assessed based on realistic threats to nonprofits and youth-focused organizations that rely heavily on cloud services, volunteer-operated accounts, and public-facing systems.

5.1 Risk Summary Table

Below is the summarized version of your risk register, presented in a narrative-friendly table for the report:

Risk ID	Risk Description	Likelihood	Impact	Score	Level
R1	Phishing attack leading to account compromise	4	4	16	High
R2	Misconfigured Google Drive exposing sensitive data	3	5	15	High
R3	Unpatched laptops used during programs & events	4	3	12	Medium
R4	Weak passwords among staff/volunteers	4	3	12	Medium
R5	Website registration portal breach	2	5	10	Medium
R6	Third-party payment vendor breach (Stripe)	2	5	10	Medium
R7	Social media account takeover	3	4	12	Medium
5.2 Key Findings
High-Priority Risks

These require immediate attention due to their impact on participant data and operational continuity:

Phishing threats (R1) — High likelihood and can lead to unauthorized access, financial fraud, or data exposure.

Cloud misconfigurations (R2) — A common issue in nonprofits; could expose sensitive donor/participant data publicly.

Medium-Priority Risks

These are significant and should be addressed systematically:

Unpatched event laptops (R3) — Common in organizations with multiple shared devices.

Weak password hygiene (R4) — Seasonal volunteers increase the chance of password reuse and compromise.

Website vulnerability (R5) — Public-facing portals are common targets for injection or credential-stuffing attacks.

Vendor risk (R6) — As a small organization, U2 Elite depends heavily on third parties; breaches could still impact the foundation.

Social media takeover (R7) — Could result in reputational damage or misinformation spread.

5.3 Overall Risk Posture

U2 Elite Foundation’s risk posture reflects that of many small nonprofits:

High dependence on cloud services

Limited internal IT resources

High exposure to phishing and misconfigurations

Mix of staff, seasonal workers, and volunteers

Third-party reliance for critical operations

With proper controls, training, and governance, the overall posture can shift to moderate or low risk within a short period.
